        <h1>Rates and Disclaimer</h1>

        <h2>Rates</h2>
        <p>
            My rates vary depending on the nature of the work and may be updated periodically. Please contact me in advance via email at 
            <a href="mailto:HarveyMichaelGarner@hotmail.com">HarveyMichaelGarner@hotmail.com</a> to confirm my current rates.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Consultation and Interview Fee Policy</h2>
        <p>
            I reserve the right to charge for any form of consultation, including but not limited to phone calls, virtual meetings, in-person meetings, 
            job interviews, recruitment discussions, and technical evaluations, at an hourly rate with a minimum fee of $100. Transportation fees may apply 
            for in-person meetings. Fees are applicable even if a meeting is scheduled but canceled or unattended.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unpaid fees may accrue interest and result in additional legal fees to ensure payment. By scheduling a consultation or interview, you agree to these terms.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Misrepresentation and Job Opportunities</h2>
        <p>
            It is expected that anyone contacting me about opportunities has thoroughly reviewed my skills, experience, and qualifications beforehand. 
            Contacting me should only occur if additional, unavailable information is required. Misrepresentation, including offering misleading or 
            nonexistent job opportunities, wastes valuable time and may result in appropriate actions, including charges for my time and potential legal consequences.
        </p>
